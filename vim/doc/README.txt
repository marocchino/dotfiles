    This plugin was  born  as  a  personal  need  to  have some little special
features from other editors into my preferred one.  The Eclipse IDE editor has
an auto-complete for  open-close  pair  of  characters  feature  that I always
wanted into Vim.

    As soon  as you type  a character that  could have a  close pair,  Eclipse
automatically puts its  pair in front of your cursor,  and  if you continue to
type and type  the close character,  Eclipse is smart enough  to not insert it
again (it just move your cursor one character forward).

    But the Eclipse editor don't stop  there.  If you type an "open" character
on any part of your code that  should not have a pair completion,  it will not
insert the close character for you.

    The AutoClose plugin is an attempt to reproduce this behavior on Vim.
